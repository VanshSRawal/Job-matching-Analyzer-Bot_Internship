# Job Matching Analyzer Project
This is a Job Matching Analyzer project.

This project is mainly based on an AI-powered bot that can evaluate resumes/CVs against specific job descriptions and requirements. The bot analyzes the candidate's resume, matches their skills and experience to the job criteria, and provides a score or ranking. Additionally the bot provides the candidate's experience in the industry along with their strengths and weaknesses
It also gives the candidate the detailed summary of the analytics and provides them with recommendations to work on to make them a better candidate.
