# Job Matching Analyzer Project
This is a Job Matching Analyzer project.

This project is mainly based on an AI-powered bot that can evaluate resumes/CVs against specific job descriptions and requirements. The bot analyzes the candidate's resume, matches their skills and experience to the job criteria, and provides a score or ranking. Additionally the bot provides the candidate's experience in the industry along with their strengths and weaknesses
It also gives the candidate the detailed summary of the analytics and provides them with recommendations to work on to make them a better candidate.


this project utilises streamlit python framework to host this bot locally 
TO run the .py file to run the Bot, open the anaconda prompt and run these lines of code:

1) conda info --envs (displays the environments created on your local PC)

2) cd internship (or your folder in which you have saved the project)

3) cd cv-matcher-bot (this is the directory in the internship folder in which the bot and its backend exists)

4) conda activate cv-matching  (activates the environment in which the directory of the bot exists , in this case the environment is cv-matching)

5) streamlit run app.py   (runs the .py file which contains the streamlit app framework that provides the frontend of the project, in this case the file name is app.py)
